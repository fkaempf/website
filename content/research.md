I study how sensory inputs are transformed into persistent internal states that drive context-appropriate behaviour.

# Internal States in Drosophila
My PhD investigates how contact chemosensation induces internal states in male *Drosophila melanogaster*. When a male fly touches another fly, pheromone cues trigger either courtship (female) or aggression (male), yet both behaviours share underlying neural circuitry through P1 neurons. I'm dissecting how the brain distinguishes these contexts and selects appropriate behavioural outputs. I combine connectomics (using the [male CNS connectome](https://male-cns.janelia.org/)), behavioural assays with optogenetic manipulation, and two-photon calcium imaging to map the circuit from sensory input to motor output.

# Neural basis of evidence integration in larval zebrafish
During my MSc, I studied the motion evidence integrator circuit in larval zebrafish: a neural system that accumulates noisy visual information to drive swim decisions. Using functionally-guided photoactivation combined with mRNA in situ hybridization, I mapped the morphology and neurotransmitter identity of circuit components, establishing a structure-to-function relationship validated against electron microscopy reconstructions. This work culminated in a [co-first author paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.14.643363) combining CLEM with functional imaging to reveal the circuit architecture underlying evidence accumulation.

Approach
My scientific path started with a childhood fascination for fish and programming, two interests that seemed unrelated until I found myself studying how neural circuits compute behaviour. From cichlid social dynamics at Lake Tanganyika to motion integration in zebrafish to internal states in flies, I've been drawn to understanding how brains implement computations that transform sensory inputs into adaptive actions. I combine connectomics with functional imaging and behavioural experiments, always looking for the link between circuit structure and the computations it performs.
